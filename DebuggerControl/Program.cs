    /// NOTES: Below is a completed test of the comparison and reporting functionality.  Please reference the VSTO diagram illustrating the core 
    /// functionality titled "VSTOBudgetTracker", located in the Documentation folder of 'Estimating.VSTO'.  Here's a quick summary of what's shown
    /// in that document: 
    ///     
    ///     1. The information for each equipment system is stored in a "SystemEstimate" object that is kept in the database.  
    ///     2. A report is received from the field and contains information about the field work performed on the equipment systems.  This report 
    ///        could cover all the systems for the project or only a few.  For each system that is reported on, the information is stored in a 
    ///        "SystemReport" object.  At this point, there will be two data object for the same system - one "SystemEstimate" and 
    ///        one "SystemReport".
    ///     3. Once SystemReport objects have been created for every system included in the report, all the SystemReports are gathered together in 
    ///        the "ReportModel".  The EstimateModel is also created at this time; it holds a SystemEstimate object for each system.
    ///     4. Both Models are sent to ModelReportingService, whose job is to perform the desired data comparisons and make those results available 
    ///        to the user.
    ///     5. The ModelReportingService presents the results as Lists of system objects, each of which can be queried further for its specific 
    ///        information.
    ///     6. There are two types of object lists returned by the ModelReportingService and they correspond with two categories of equipment 
    ///        system: those that are included in the field report and those that are not.  For those NOT included, no data checking occurs and
    ///        they are returned by the ModelReportingService via a List of "SystemEstimate" objects (since nothing changed).  For those that 
    ///        WERE included, the ModelReportingService returns the results via a list of "ComparatorResult" objects.  Please see the class 
    ///        definition of ComparatorResult for a list of what information it contains.

            //play a role here; by choosing to commit estimate data to the database, we can add checks to prevent duplicate system names.  Also, 
            //since the system names that will come back in the field report are created when "preparing" the drawings with Spaces, the burden of 
            //ensuring accuracy falls on you and the Estimating department, which is better than leaving it open-ended.  Finally, we can safely 
            //assume that if a system name in a field report DOESN'T match with anything in the estimate record, it probably matches something very
            //closely and is only off by a letter, a Capitalized/Uncapitalized letter, a hypHen, etc.  and we can easily add simple validation 
            //checks to detect and correct these issues.

            //mix or results.

            //
            //      1.  No work has been done on the WEST trash exhaust or corridor supply systems, so there are no phase codes shown in the 
            //          markups for those systems. 
            //      2.  The GarageExhaust has been completed, so all the phase codes that were included for that system are shown in the 
            //          markup data. 
            //      3.  The EAST TrashExhaust is in the process of being completed.  Phase codes 0701, 0601, and 0501 appear in the markups for this
            //          system, but code 0401 (the remaining code for that system estimate) does not.  
            //      4.  The EAST CorridorSupply is also in process.  Phase code 0701 appears in the markups, but the remaining code (0401) does
